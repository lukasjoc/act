- being able to store remote host addresses
- benig able to address certain known hosts
- counter inital value should be a param in the spawn
 - would need to only create actors when they get spawned
 - would need to refactor the actor creation a bit (but it makes sense)
    why create it if its not used (yet)
```
actor counter initial = DEC {1 -=}, INC {1 -+};
c = spawn {counter 37};
c1 = spawn {counter 138};
```

- create new actors
- decide what to do on certain messages
```
- default messages to set value for each actor
```act
foobar <- SET 5;
foobar <- SET 0;
```
