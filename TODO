- counter inital value should be a param in the spawn
 - would need to only create actors when they get spawned
 - would need to refactor the actor creation a bit (but it makes sense)
```
actor counter initial = DEC {1 -=}, INC {1 -+};
c = spawn {counter 37};
c1 = spawn {counter 138};
```
- refer to `@` properly (currently bidi comm is only allowed with the fake `@` proc)
- pattern match with default case
- better execution scope expr handling
- actors also want to spawn new actors and communicate
- lex and parse opTypes into the tokens instead of string matching them (badly)
- flush() like in erlang
- tokenstream for lexer and parsing infra

?? custom pre-emptive scheduler (from scratch in ANSI C) (CGO)
